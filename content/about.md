I've been a Software Engineer, Tester, Systems Engineer for the last 15+ years.


My current role is called "Cloud Architect", and I'm primarily working in the cloud infrastructure sphere.
This includes everything from getting a server installed, and connected to the dedicated cluster, keeping it up to date, as well as logging and monitoring for all the services.
My main focused is on [OpenStack](https://openstack.org) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).
I'm very deep in forcing Design Documents as an entrypoint for discussions, as well as documentation of the results.


I do less coding than I'd prefere, but these days it is done in either [python](https://python.org) or [Go](https://golang.org), depending on my mood, and who is supposed to also edit the code.


Occasionally I try to teach people on

* Python for Sys Admins
* How to use a cloud?
 * Caveats of running on a cloud
 * Todays Ok-ish practices 
* Our infrastructure
 * The whys and the hows


But most important. I try to spend as much time with my kids as possible. And when there is some spare time, you'll likely find me running, cycling, or having a beer.
